## Experiments with speech neuroprosthesis

Experiments with speech BCI data from the [Brain-to-Text 2024 Benchmark](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2099/overview) kindly made available by Willett, Kunz, Fan, *et al*.

We make a copy of the experimental data available in [this Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/eminorhan/speech-bci-willett), reformatted to make it easier to use for machine learning experiments. The experimental data was graciously released to the public domain by the authors (originally [here](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.x69p8czpq)), so it holds no copyrights.
